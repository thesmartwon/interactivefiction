This is the readme for the instructor.

Game: "The Belle of the South"
Team: Diya Yang
	  Tyler Wert
	  Zack Allen
	  Cassandra Keesee
Instructions: Extracting this archive and opening Team_Rocket_final.html should work. The game is self explanatory, click on the text links in-game. If it does not work, and time is of the essense, contact zrallen@ncsu.edu, and I'll host it online.

Disclaimer: We didn't have time to perfect this game. Two game logs and a midterm happened in between the one month we had for this project, and less than 10 minutes was dedicated to Twine in-class. The instructor mentioned that we *actually* don't need to include images just two days ago, which through off some of our plans. In the end, we think we produced a good game though, especially if you just look at the text. In fact, all of it is historically accurate!
