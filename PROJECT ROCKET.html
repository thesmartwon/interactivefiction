The sun shines down on a small home in Martinsburg, Virginia. The year is 1851, and you are a seven year old by the name of Isabella Maria Boyd. You think that name is a little bit too long for you, so you go by Belle Boyd instead. Though the weather is idyllic, you feel as if there is something suspicious going on. Lots of noise if coming from your house. Your cousin Nick is in there, who still needs to be taught a lesson on who is faster, smarter, and better looking. You could [[check out what&#39;s going on-&gt;Investigate]], or just [[ignore it.-&gt;Ignore]]

**$currentpassage**

The best way to ignore everyone has always been to go to your room. You go there, and sit on your bed. The silence of the house is broken by the laughter of children outside. Maybe you should just join their game of hide and go seek? The oldest person, your brother Bill, would let you [[join in late (with some convincing).-&gt;Demand to Play]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Investigate" tags="" position="500,500">(set: $currentpassage to (passage:)&#39;s name)
**$currentpassage**

The house is silent. You creep around the house, looking to see if anything’s going on. But it’s quiet. Too quiet. You hear the faint sounds of childish laughter from outside. Peering through the window, you can see your cousins and siblings running to go hide, and your oldest brother, Bill, is counting to ten. They look to be playing a game--without you! Nick could be convinced to [[let you play-&gt;Demand to Play]], or you could always [[ignore them.-&gt;Ignore]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Demand to Play" tags="" position="700,700">(set: $currentpassage to (passage:)&#39;s name)

You walk outside, catching your brother right before he finishes counting. “I want to play too! Can you recount? I’ll go hide!” Your brother knows how stubborn you are, and tells you to go find a good place, he’ll recount. &quot;Thanks!&quot;

Where do you hide?
[[Hide in kitchen]]

There’s a few good places to hide in the yard. The [[front bushes-&gt;Hide behind a bush]] look large enough to stand behind, or you could have enough time to climb a [[tree just around the corner-&gt;Hide in a tree]] before your brother would come close.</tw-passagedata>

Oh, Bill is afraid to even come into this room. He had been told multiple times not to, but he probably would check it out anyway. There’s a few good places to hide in your room. Should you hide in [[the closet-&gt;Hide in closet]], or [[under the bed?-&gt;Hide under bed]]</tw-passagedata>

You raise the broom above your head victoriously, then stand in a corner with it in front of you. This is the perfect disguise. No one will suspect anything. You are a god. The lord of brooms. You are powerful. Sadly, though, [[your brother walks near...-&gt;You lose]]

Ugh, you thought that was such a good hiding spot too!
You take one of pa&#39;s books off of the living room bookshelf to read until the game is over.
Everyone slowly piled in. He found them all. To be fair, he is the best seeker, maybe even better than you.

“That was a pretty good hiding spot, I guess.” Your brother is totally mocking you. You stick out your tongue at him. “Better luck next time!” He promises.

Oh, you will have better luck. [[You’re going to win.-&gt;5 years go by]]</tw-passagedata>

You sit on the front step of your home, looking at growing figures of soldiers in the distance. You didn’t quite like the Union soldiers, but you didn&#39;t dislike them, either. Some could be manipulated, they were just on the wrong side, that&#39;s all. 

Two rode up to your house, hopping off their horses. 

“You got a father we can speak to?” 

You may not dislike most, but these two are obviously going to be an exception, especially when they’re so brash like that. 
“I may. I certainly have a mother.”

“Sounds like a yes. Well, a good mother certainly wouldn’t mind us hanging up this here flag on your house.”
He brandishes a union flag threateningly. “Don’t know how good of a mother she’d be with a rude lady like you.” He looks you up and down in a way you don’t like. You’re about to tell him off, when your mother arrives on the front porch.

“What’s keeping you soldiers? We’re lawful citizens, we don’t make any trouble.”

“No trouble? Your little daughter here is creating some. Keep her on a tighter grip.”

You open your mouth to argue, but your mother is speaking again. You let her continue, she knows that you did nothing wrong. 

“Belle is much more respectful than any of you gentlemen are being now. Now, what do you want with us?” 

Apparently, this insinuation is a little too much for the soldier. The man’s face turns red, and you watch with horror as he begins to insult your mother in a colorful ways you’ve only heard from rapscallions. He pushes her, and she stands there, taking it. Eventually, he remembers what he&#39;s here for and tells her he wants to hang the flag, and that the penalty for taking it down would be severe.

“Go ahead,” ma said. “Hang it.” She walked away.

The quieter soldier started to hang it, but the other stayed with you. He keeps talking about the superiority of the union, and it’s the calling of your mother by rude names that’s the last straw.

You show him how respectful of a daughter you are. [[You’d never let someone get away with insulting your mother.-&gt;Tell him to stop]]</tw-passagedata>

You can stay quiet no longer. “Stop talking about ma like that,” you say. “She let you hang your flag, so let her be.”

“Oh, your mom, dearie... she deserves hell.”

He can&#39;t talk like this. You must [[take a stand.-&gt;Shoot him]]</tw-passagedata>

You pull out your pistol, and with the grace of years of practice, shoot the rude soldier in the head. 

He falls over, dead. [[There will be repercussions for this, though.-&gt;Go to court]]</tw-passagedata>

His death was investigated, but apparently the man you’d shot was such a rude man, even his commanding officer disliked him. They said you were in the right, and that the soldier had overstepped his boundaries. Union soldiers were assigned to watch the house to make sure the flag was still up, but that&#39;s it.</tw-passagedata>

The party tomorrow was going to be the most fun party of the year. All your best friends were going, not to mention your family, who you also liked. There were going to be dinner games, extravagent food, and the best entertainment. You had to get pa to let you go tomorrow. At the dinner table, your brother Bill, sister Mary, ma and pa were all there. Bill was going for sure, how could you play this to get to go to? [[Strike up a conversation with pa]] might work, but [[talking about your close friendship with your brother-&gt;Talk to your brother]] might work as well.

“Well, I’m goin’ to my shop, it’s open like always,” he replied.
“What about in the evening?”
“Oh, me, ma, and Bill are going over to the Carlson’s for dinner.”
“Can I come?”
“You’re a little young there, missy,” he laughed.

Ma quickly swallows.
“We are going to an adult dinner party at the Carlson’s, Belle. Your father and I have already talked about it, only Bill is coming too.”
“But maa..”
“You can’t go Belle, that’s final.”
“But people younger than me are going, ma. And besides, I know everyone there.”
“No,” your father sternly says, “and that’s final.”
Bill looks at you, a little sad. Well, pa wasn&#39;t going to change his mind. It seems like you [[are not allowed to go-&gt;Not allowed to go???]]</tw-passagedata>

“Ugh,” you say, offended. This was not okay. You were going to be bored out of your mind tomorrow with only Mary Jane in the evening. You would also have extra responsibilities around the house, but that isn’t what bothered you. What bothered you was that everyone you knew in town from the past year, was going to that party. You had gotten to know all these people, and spent a lot of time with them, the whole year in fact. Sure, most of them were older than you, but some of them were your age. You had learned so much about them through gossiping, and you wanted to learn more about them, it was all so thrilling. How else could you help them? You had to go.

You have to get his approval. He is your dad, but you were 12 now, and had your own horse. You had been doing errands in town for over a year now. You weren&#39;t a little kid anymore.
“But you know I&#39;ve always been mature for my age, and besides, I know everyone there.”
“Well that don&#39;t mean they know you.”
“Kids even younger than me are going, dad.”
“Cuz their parents have no place to put ‘em,” he said, “it’s an adult dinner party.”
“Please?”
“No.”

“What are you doing tomorrow evening, Bill?”
He is quiet for a second, thinking and chewing, and raises a finger once he remembers. He swallows.
“Oh, we have something special planned,” he said jovially, eyes gleaming. “We going to the Carlson’s for dinner. Ooh, there gonna be so many pretty girls, good food, music, games, and the whole place, even the outside, is candlelit.” He paused, taking another bite. Pa looked at him, smirking.
“Good thing it’s a Friday, I’m going to be up all night! She can come as long as she leaves early, can’t she pa?”
“No, son, she is a little too young. We don’t want any boys looking at her yet, and besides, someone has to look after Mary Jane.”
“Mary Jane is fine,” Bill said, “we have plenty of food, and she can fix it.”
“She is still too young.”
“Oh, pa, both my sisters would look after themselves.”
“Please pa,” you say.
“No.”

Well, Mary Jane did need to be looked after, and if ma or pa spotted you, you would get severely punished. They would take your horse and not allow any play for weeks, maybe even months. You couldn&#39;t let that happen.
You snuck into pa&#39;s room and got the newspapers for the past few weeks. This would pass the time. [[Oh, what an uneventful night.-&gt;Another 5 years go by]]</tw-passagedata>

The humongous doors are closed, but bright candelights come from behind them. You knock, quietly, and a servant answers. The light blinds you for a second, and then you realize, oh, you are caught. The dinner table is just inside the front door (what type of house is this?). Worst of all, ma and pa are sitting facing the door, they see you first. All the guests gasp. Some seem aghast, some laugh, but all of them quiet down upon your entrance. Pa stands.
“You’re too young, Belle. I told you to stay home,” he bellowed.
The room was still dead silent. Mr. Carlson, at the head of the table, was still looking straight at you. Think fast, think fast.
“Well, my horse is old enough, isn’t he?” you declare.
They all laughed. You smiled, this was golden. Mr. Carlson stood up.
“Let her stay, and show her where the stables are now that her horse got her in here,” he looked around and laughed disgustingly, wine goblet in hand. Everyone resumed talking and eating. Pa shook his head and sat down. You were in. This night was going to be great.
You party, making new contacts, catching up on gossip, and witnessing all the events that happen. In fact, you blend in so well, many forget you are here, despite your dramatic entrance. [[All good things must come to an end, though…-&gt;Another 5 years go by]]
