The sun shines down on a small home in Martinsburg, Virginia. The year is 1851, and you are a seven year old by the name of Isabella Maria Boyd. You think that name is a little bit too long for you, so you go by Belle instead. Though the weather is idyllic, you feel as if there is something suspicious going on. Lots of noise if coming from your house. Your cousin Nick is in there, who still needs to be taught a lesson on who is faster, smarter, and better looking. You could [[check out what&#39;s going on-&gt;Investigate]], or just [[ignore it.-&gt;Ignore]]

The best way to ignore everyone has always been to go to your room. You go there and sit on your bed. The silence of the house is broken by the laughter of children outside. Maybe you should just join their game of hide and go seek? The oldest kid, your brother Bill, would let you [[join in late with some convincing.-&gt;Demand to Play]]</tw-passagedata>

The house is silent. You creep around the house, looking to see if anything’s going on. But it’s quiet. Too quiet. You hear the faint sounds of childish laughter from outside. Peering through the window, you can see your cousins and siblings running to go hide, and your oldest brother, Bill, is counting to ten. They look to be playing a game--without you!

The year is 1860. The Civil War starts with the election of Abraham Lincoln, and soon thereafter, the secession of South Carolina. Your Pa is one of the first to volunteer for the South. He was offered a high position; but, like many other Virginian gentlemen, he refused, leaving the pay and honor of an officer&#39;s commission to other, less fortunate men.

The home was desolate and lonely without him. The excitement of preparing him for war was gone, and the reality of the situation had set in. Ma&#39;s face began to wear an anxious, careworn expression. Nights were not passed in sleep, but in thinking painfully of the loved one who was exposed to the dangers of war. Other Southern women felt similarly. Inaction started to bother you very quickly. It wasn&#39;t before long that you had your [[first adventure as a Virginian Rebel.-&gt;First adventure]].</tw-passagedata>

In reality, Maria Isabella Boyd really was an integral part of the Confederacy winning the Battle of Front Royal. She grew up in Martinsburg, Virginia and was always described as being carefree and a bit reckless. 
Her life as a spy began when she was 17 years old with the killing of the Union soldier as it is told in our story. This action resulted in Union officers being posted outside of her home, giving her the opportunity to gain information and help the Confederates. After gaining notoriety, along with more than a few prison sentences, Boyd was able to give Stonewall Jackson the information that allowed his troops to take back Front Royal. After her career as a spy, Belle left the country with the help of Sam Hardinge and went to England where she became a successful actress. Following her first husband’s death in 1866 she came back to America. 
Continuing her stage career, Boyd traveled the country telling stories of her life as a southern spy. She married John Hammond in 1869 and enjoyed sixteen years of marriage as well as had four children before divorcing him and marrying Nathaniel High two months later. 
Maria Isabella Boyd died on June 11, 1900 at 56 years of age. She died of a heart attack on stage in Wisconsin, speaking of her experiences in Confederate espionage.

You are sitting on the front step of your home, looking at growing figures of soldiers in the distance. You didn’t really like the Union soldiers, but you didn&#39;t dislike them either. Some could be manipulated, they were just on the wrong side, that&#39;s all. 

Two rode up to your house, hopping off their horses. 

“You got a father we can speak to?” 

You may not dislike most, but these two are obviously going to be an exception, especially when they act so brash like that.

“He&#39;s at war. But I certainly have a mother.”

“Well, a good mother certainly wouldn’t mind us hanging up this here flag on your house.”

He brandishes a union flag threateningly. “Don’t know how good of a mother she’d be with a rude lady like you,” he says, looking you up and down in a way you don’t like.

You’re about to tell him off, when your mother arrives on the front porch.

“What’s keeping you soldiers? We’re lawful citizens, we don’t make any trouble.”

“No trouble? Your little daughter here is creating some. Keep a tighter grip on her.”

You open your mouth to argue, but your mother is speaking again. You let her continue, she knows that you did nothing wrong. 

“Belle is much more respectful than any of you gentlemen are being now. Now, what do you want with us?” 

Apparently, this insinuation is a little too much for the soldier. The man’s face turns red, and you watch with horror as he begins to insult your mother in a colorful ways you’ve only heard from rapscallions. He pushes her, and she stands there, taking it. Eventually, he remembers what he&#39;s here for and tells her he wants to hang the flag, and that the penalty for taking it down would be severe.

“Go ahead,” ma said. “Hang it.” She was beyond mad.

The quieter soldier starts to hang it, but the other stays with you. He keeps talking about the superiority of the Union, and it’s the calling of your mother by rude names that’s the last straw.

The next morning, General Shields comes to meet with you in person. He was an Irishman, and proudly so, as he wore their better graces of manner and notorious sense of humor.
He replies, “Oh, I could never let you go because old Jackson&#39;s army is so demoralized that they&#39;re going to be wiped out in a few days. Then, you can go where you please.”
“Oh -- is that so?” you ask.
“Absolutely,” he admonished. “Let me show you the men who, alongside me, will do it.”
He led you back to the house, clearly oblivious to the fact that sometimes a woman could listen and remember. Here he introduced you to two young Irishman.
One of them was a captain named [[Kelley.-&gt;Mr. Kelley]] The other was a First Lieutenant named [[Jamison.-&gt;Mr. Jamison]]</tw-passagedata>

You are able to extract a lot of information from Mr. Kelley, he almost forgets that it is wartime, not love time. You learn of a meeting happening this very night in what was formerly your aunt’s drawing room. Immediately above this was a bedchamber, containing a closet, through the floor of which you remembered there was a hole. You didn&#39;t know whether or not it was good for eavesdropping, though. As soon as the council of war assembled at the correct time, you can [[sneak upstairs to the bedchamber-&gt;Sneak upstairs to the bedchamber]] or [[hide behind a shelf in the drawing room.-&gt;Hide in the drawing room]]</tw-passagedata>

It&#39;ll be a problem if you can&#39;t hear them, but it&#39;ll be even worse if you get caught. After weighing your options, you decide to sneak upstairs to the bedchamber and listen in through the closet, hoping that the hole would be large enough to hear through.

You lay down in the floor of the closet, and to your delight you can distinctly hear the conversation that was passing below. You remained there for hours until they came to a conclusion, to  march south, laying a trap, as he supposed, to catch &quot;poor old Jackson and his demoralized army.&quot; However, he would only leave behind one squadron of cavalry, one field battery, and the 1st Maryland Regiment of Infantry to occupy Front Royal. This was Confederacy&#39;s chance to attack.

The journey to relay the information could be a dangerous one, while this could be pertinent information, it may not make any difference at all.

In the very act of dismounting, a door on your right is thrown open, revealing Colonel Ashby himself, who could not conceal his surprise at seeing you standing before him.

“Good God! Miss Belle, is that you? Where did you come from? Have you dropped from the clouds? Or am I dreaming?”

You first convince him he is wide awake, and that your presence was substantial and of the earth - not a visionary emanation from the world of spirits - then, without further circumlocution, you tell him all you had overheard from the closet. You gave him the cipher, and started on your return to Front Royal.

Mr. Jamison was also an Irishman, but the qualities he possessed were not quite like those of General Shields. He had picked up the lesser qualities of the Irish, already slightly intoxicated on the job. After General Shields leaves, you talk to Mr. Jamison, but Mr. Kelley sticks around. Both of them inquire about your business, and what brings you to Front Royal.
You tell them about your family here, and desire to bring them to Martinsburg.
Mr. Kelley seems far more interested in you, and far more vunerable. It&#39;s definitely in your best interest to [[focus on him.-&gt;Mr. Kelley]]</tw-passagedata>

You immediately regret your decision, this man continues to unrelentlessly insult your mother. He spouts slurs you didn&#39;t even know of, for no apparent reason.

You go about your day as normal, minding your own business. You may or may not have missed out on some passing conversations of some union members that could be useful for upcoming battles, but you&#39;re trying to stay in line this time, it&#39;s not worth getting arrested yet again. 
Or so you thought, before soon, the enthusiasm of the battle overtook you and the town.

Everyone in the neighbourhood showed much enthusiasm in preparing, in the shortest possible time, supplies for our suffering heroes. You bore your part, and before long was duly installed one of the &quot;matrons.&quot;

The motto of your father&#39;s regiment is engraved on your heart, and you trust that you have always shown by your actions, starting with the defense of your mother, that you understood its significance.

After six or eight weeks spent in incessant nursing, you weren’t feeling so good. The other nurses insisted that you [[return home to recover your health,-&gt;Return home]] which had suffered severely.</tw-passagedata>

You had to tell the nearest Confederate colonel, Colonel Ashby, who was only 15 miles away.

You run to your room and write a cipher containing all the relevant bits of information. It is 3 in the morning now. Rather than cause a stir by waking a servant and risking getting caught, you go straight to your horse and leave for Colonel Ashby. Twice, you are stopped by sentries, but thankfully you have forged papers to get by. [[You arrive at Colonel Ashby&#39;s house.]]</tw-passagedata>
