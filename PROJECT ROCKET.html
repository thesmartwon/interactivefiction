The sun shines down on a small home in Martinsburg, Virginia. The year is 1851, and you are a seven year old by the name of Isabella Maria Boyd. You think that name is a little bit too long for you, so you go by Belle Boyd instead. Though the weather is idyllic, you feel as if there is something suspicious going on. Lots of noise if coming from your house. Your cousin Nick is in there, who still needs to be taught a lesson on who is faster, smarter, and better looking. You could [[check out what&#39;s going on-&gt;Investigate]], or just [[ignore it.-&gt;Ignore]]

The best way to ignore everyone has always been to go to your room. You go there, and sit on your bed. The silence of the house is broken by the laughter of children outside. Maybe you should just join their game of hide and go seek? The oldest person, your brother Bill, would let you [[join in late (with some convincing).-&gt;Demand to Play]]</tw-passagedata>

The house is silent. You creep around the house, looking to see if anything’s going on. But it’s quiet. Too quiet. You hear the faint sounds of childish laughter from outside. Peering through the window, you can see your cousins and siblings running to go hide, and your oldest brother, Bill, is counting to ten. They look to be playing a game--without you! Nick could be convinced to [[let you play-&gt;Demand to Play]], or you could always [[ignore them.-&gt;Ignore]]</tw-passagedata>

The year is 1860. The Civil War starts with the election of Abraham Lincoln, and soonafter secession of South Carolina. Your Pa is one of the first to volunteer for the South. He was offered a high position; but, like many of your Virginian gentlemen, he refused, leaving the pay and honor of an officer&#39;s commission to other less fortunate men.

The home was desolate and lonely without him. The excitement of preparing him for war was gone, and the reaction of the feeling had set in. Ma&#39;s face began to wear an axious, careworn expression. Nights were not passed in sleep, but in thinking painfully of the loved one who was exposed to the dangers of war. Other Southern women felt similarly. Before long, inaction started to bother you. It wasn&#39;t before long that you had your [[first adventure being a Virginian Rebel.-&gt;First adventure]].</tw-passagedata>

His death was investigated, but apparently the man you’d shot was not very popular, even his commanding officer disliked him. With some sweet talking, they said your actions were justified, and that the soldier had overstepped his boundaries. Union soldiers were assigned to watch the house to make sure that you had no other problems, but that&#39;s it. You decorated your room with Confederate flags, laughing at them through the window.

The year is 1856. The party tomorrow was going to be the most fun party of the year. All your best friends were going, not to mention your family, who you also liked. There were going to be dinner games, extravagent food, and the best entertainment. You had to get pa to let you go tomorrow. At the dinner table, your brother Bill, sister Mary, ma and pa were all there. Bill was going for sure, how could you play this to get to go to?

“But people younger than me are going, ma. And besides, I know everyone there.”

“Ugh,” you say, offended. This was not okay. You were going to be bored out of your mind tomorrow with only Mary Jane in the evening. You would also have extra responsibilities around the house, but that isn’t what bothered you. What bothered you was that everyone you knew in town from the past year, was going to that party. You had gotten to know all these people, and spent a lot of time with them, the whole year in fact. Sure, most of them were older than you, but some of them were your age. You had learned so much about them through gossiping, and you wanted to learn more about them, it was all so thrilling. How else could you help them? You had to go.

“Good thing it’s a Friday, I’m going to be up all night! She can come as long as she leaves early, can’t she pa?”
“No, son, she is a little too young. We don’t want any boys looking at her yet, and besides, someone has to look after Mary Jane.”

Some seem aghast, some laugh, but all of them quiet down upon your entrance. Pa stands.
“You’re too young, Belle. I told you to stay home,” he bellowed.
The room was still dead silent. Mr. Carlson, at the head of the table, was still looking straight at you. Think fast, think fast.
“Well, my horse is old enough, isn’t he?” you declare.
They all laughed. You smiled, this was golden. Mr. Carlson stood up.
“Let her stay, and show her where the stables are now that her horse got her in here,” he looked around and laughed disgustingly, wine goblet in hand. Everyone resumed talking and eating. Pa shook his head and sat down. You were in. This night was going to be great.
You party, making new contacts, catching up on gossip, and witnessing all the events that happen. In fact, you blend in so well, many forget you are here, despite your dramatic entrance. [[All good things must come to an end, though…-&gt;4 years pass]]

In reality, Maria Isabella Boyd really was an integral part of the Confederacy winning the Battle of Front Royal. She grew up in Martinsburg, Virginia and was always described as being carefree and a bit reckless. Her life as a spy began when she was 17 years old with the killing of the Union soldier as it is told in the game. This action resulted in Union officers being posted outside of her home, giving her the opportunity to gain information and help the Confederates. After gaining notoriety and more than a few prison sentences, Boyd gave Stonewall Jackson the information that allowed his troops to take back Front Royal. After her career as a spy, Belle left the country with the help of Sam Hardinge and went to England where she became a successful actress. Following her first husband’s death, she came back to America in 1866. Continuing her stage career, Boyd traveled the country telling stories of her life as a southern spy. She married John Hammond in 1869 and enjoyed sixteen years of marriage as well as had four children before divorcing him and marrying Nathaniel High two months later. Maria Isabella Boyd died on June 11, 1900 at 56 years of age. She died of a heart attack on stage in Wisconsin, speaking of her experiences in Confederate espionage.

You are sitting on the front step of your home, looking at growing figures of soldiers in the distance. You didn’t quite like the Union soldiers, but you didn&#39;t dislike them, either. Some could be manipulated, they were just on the wrong side, that&#39;s all. 

Two rode up to your house, hopping off their horses. 

“You got a father we can speak to?” 

You may not dislike most, but these two are obviously going to be an exception, especially when they’re so brash like that. 
“He&#39;s at war. I certainly have a mother.”

“Well, a good mother certainly wouldn’t mind us hanging up this here flag on your house.”
He brandishes a union flag threateningly. “Don’t know how good of a mother she’d be with a rude lady like you.” He looks you up and down in a way you don’t like. You’re about to tell him off, when your mother arrives on the front porch.

“What’s keeping you soldiers? We’re lawful citizens, we don’t make any trouble.”

“No trouble? Your little daughter here is creating some. Keep her on a tighter grip.”

You open your mouth to argue, but your mother is speaking again. You let her continue, she knows that you did nothing wrong. 

“Belle is much more respectful than any of you gentlemen are being now. Now, what do you want with us?” 

Apparently, this insinuation is a little too much for the soldier. The man’s face turns red, and you watch with horror as he begins to insult your mother in a colorful ways you’ve only heard from rapscallions. He pushes her, and she stands there, taking it. Eventually, he remembers what he&#39;s here for and tells her he wants to hang the flag, and that the penalty for taking it down would be severe.

“Go ahead,” ma said. “Hang it.” She was beyond mad.

The quieter soldier started to hang it, but the other stayed with you. He keeps talking about the superiority of the union, and it’s the calling of your mother by rude names that’s the last straw.

One of them was a captain named [[Mr. Kelley.-&gt;Mr. Kelley]]</tw-passagedata>

You are able to extract information from. You learn of a meeting happening this very night in what was formerly your aunt’s drawing room. Immediately above this was a bedchamber, containing a closet, through the floor of which you remembered there was a hole. As soon as the council of war assembled at the correct time, you [[sneak upstairs to the bedchamber.-&gt;Sneak upstairs to the bedchamber]]</tw-passagedata>

You lay down in the floor of the closet, and to your delight you can distinctly hear the conversation that was passing below. You remained there for hours until they came to a conclusion, a conclusion to  march south, laying a trap, as he supposed, to catch &quot;poor old Jackson and his demoralized army.&quot; However, he would only leave behind him, to occupy Front Royal, one squadron of cavalry, one field battery, and the 1st Maryland Regiment of Infantry. This was Confederacy&#39;s chance to attack. You had to tell the nearest Confederate colonel, Colonel Ashby, who was only 15 miles away.
You run to your room and write a cipher containing all the relevant bits of information that could be used. It is 3 in the morning now. Rather than cause a stir by waking a servant and raisking getting caught, you go straight to your horse and leave for Colonel Ashby. Twice, you are stopped by sentries, but thankfully you have forged papers to get by. [[You arrive at Colonel Ashby&#39;s house.]]</tw-passagedata>

In the very act of dismounting a door on your right was thrown open, and revealed Colonel Ashby himself, who could not conceal his surprise at seeing you standing before him.

“Good God! Miss Belle, is this you? Where did you come from? Have you dropped from the clouds? or am I dreaming?”

You first convince him he is wide awake, and that your presence was substantial and of the earth - not a visionary emanation from the world of spirits - then, without farther circumlocution, I tell him all you had overheard in the closet. You gave him the cipher, and started on your return to Front Royal. Within weeks, at the planned time, [[Jackson&#39;s army came to retake Front Royal.-&gt;Front Royal Confederate again]]</tw-passagedata>
